        I am Real Dewan a tech lover and music lover. I love to do coding.
        Currently, I am pursuing Computer Science degree at European University
        of Bangladesh(EUB). Though I did not start problem solving on online
        judge, I will be starting problem solving end of this year.

        Early in 2008, I read an article about kids in USA knows visual basic
        and they are able to hack into a game so that they can play games freely
        which are paid games. It inspired me to learn hacking. But to know
        hacking a person must know Programming and Networking both. And in that
        time I started going to Cyber Cafe as I did not own a computer and
        started reading tech blogs. I spent a lot of time on finding resources
        every weekend. During that time, in Rangamati internet connection was
        very slow. I used to take notes of everything I found interesting. One
        day I found about SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting(XSS) and many
        other techniques of hacking. I started note down about them. I basically
        started learning SQL Injection and XSS in this way. It took me a long
        time to learn them. I started practicing them in 2010 on a platform
        called SQL Ninja. In that time I was able to solve the SQL Injection
        problems from Level 1 to Level 15. But I could not solve the rest 15
        levels. Though I learned them, I did not access in any web application
        unethically. I just used to find out if any web application has
        vulnerabilities and if I found anything, I inform them via email about
        their security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Practicing penetration testing deeper, I used to know about many tools
        but I was never fond of tools but doing them manually. I always wanted
        to know how the softwares actually work, why are the most web
        applications vulnerable in that time. Point to be noted, I have quit
        practicing penetration testing in 2015 because I was bored. I always was
        keen to know what makes a web application vulnerable, how can we keep it
        safe from black hat hackers. And after that, I went for learning web
        dev. The journey was not good. Because in that time most of the contents
        on YouTube were filled with Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal. I tried them to
        learn but I was not satisfied because there were not much of coding in
        CMS. In CMS what you need is just click and install. When you do not
        know how those tools actually works, you should probably end up like me.
        So do I. We a group of science lovers from Chittagong Hill Tracts
        created a group on Facebook in 2013 and always used to share regular
        tech news, mathematical problems, science articles and so on. We have
        also hosted a science blog made with wordpress in that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later in 2020, during the first lockdown I came to know bunch of techy
        Jumma People from Chittagong Hill Tracts who are in many sectors like
        software industry, networking industry and so on. With the connectivity
        of these techy people I became keen to learn technology again. One of
        them is now lives in Australia who studied CSE in BUET in 90's decade
        and after that he got scholarship in Australia and pursued the degree
        Bachelor of Computing and completed his degree in 1996. Since then, he
        is in software industry. He adviced me to learn ReactJS. Regular
        sessions of the community inspired me to learn again and in the last
        year I found out about Programming Hero. I read all the written contents
        about this course and could not resist myself to enroll the course.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping to learn typescript when the main course ends. Beside, I
        have also interest in material-ui.
        <br />
        Furthermore, I am keen to learn about hashing algorithms because if devs
        can encrypt users' passwords with very strong hashing algorithm, they
        would be secured unless the algorithm is leaked. I respect everyone's
        privacy and believe in safety in internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides JavaScript I have also learned C and Java fundamentals at my
        university. So whenever the course ends, I will be starting practicing
        them also as I made a routine to practice them once a week. Also, I am
        very keen to learn backend framework Spring by Java.
